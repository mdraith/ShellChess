# ShellChess
Shell Chess is a text based brute force chess program for the Linux Terminal.


Extract for ARM 64-Bit Linux:

tar -xJf shellchess-linux-arm64-1.0.tar.xz

Extract for Intel or AMD 64-Bit Linux:

tar -xJf shellchess-linux-x86_64-1.0.tar.xz


A new directory ShellChess will be created.


Just enter the move you want to make in small letters.


To play the black pieces enter the command 'side'.


For a much weaker opponent enter 'dpth' and after pressing Enter a number between 1 (very weak) and 3 (novice).


For benchmarking changes to the code do the following:

'dpth' should be set to a matching depth maybe 10 | 'extn' should be off to disable move extension | 'rand' should be off to disable random moves | 'book' should be off to disable book openings | 'test' to start the benchmark from a test position
